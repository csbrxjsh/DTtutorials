# DT Tutorials

Small collection of JavaScript exercises and demos used for learning.

Contents
- `index.html` — landing page with links to activities
- `Activity-2/` — Celsius to Fahrenheit converter
- `Activity-3/` — Grade calculator (HTML + `gradecalculator.js`)
- `Activity-4/` — Number guessing game (uses alert/prompt)

Notes
- The activity folders were renamed from `Activity#*` to `Activity-*` to avoid URL fragment problems on static hosting.
- To test locally: `python -m http.server 8000` and open `http://localhost:8000/`.
